# Terraform AWS Lambda Function

This is an opinionated setup that uses Terraform to manage an AWS Lambda function.

## What will this setup do?

This is a Terraform configuration that manages the an AWS EKS stack. It will create the following resources:

- AWS Lambda Function
- AWS ECR Repository
- Docker Image Build and Push to AWS ECR repository

This setup the Terraform CLI to manage the IllumiDesk stack using Terraform Workspaces.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

    - [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
    - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    - [sam cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
    - [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

You must have an AWS account and provide your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key.

The values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` should be saved as environment variables on your workspace or they can be provided as variables in the `*.tfvars` file.

## Quick Start

Copy the `example.tfvars` file to `<environment>.tfvars` and update the values with your AWS credentials.

```bash
cp example.tfvars dev.tfvars
```

Create and/or select a Terraform workspace.

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
```

Initialize the Terraform configuration.

```bash
terraform init
```

Plan the Terraform configuration.

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

Apply the Terraform configuration.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

### Assert the Lambda Function with Boto3

From the `tests/lambda_function` directory, run the following command to test the Lambda function with Boto3. Ensure that the `ARN` value is exported with the `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN` environment variable before executing the test:

```bash
# example for development environment lambda function
export LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN=arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:860100747351:function:app-dev-docker-lambda_handler
python test_lambda_with_arn.py
```

This should output a result similar to the following:

```bash
{'statusCode': 200, 'body': '{"result": {"a": 5, "b": 20}}'}
```
